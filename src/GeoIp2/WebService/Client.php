/**
 * This class provides a client API for all the GeoIP2 web service's
 * end points. The end points are Country, City, City/ISP/Org, and Omni. Each
 * end point returns a different set of data about an IP address, with Country
 * returning the least data and Omni the most.
 *
 * Each web service end point is represented by a different model class, and
 * these model classes in turn contain multiple Record classes. The record
 * classes have attributes which contain data about the IP address.
 *
 * If the web service does not return a particular piece of data for an IP
 * address, the associated attribute is not populated.
 *
 * The web service may not return any information for an entire record, in
 * which case all of the attributes for that record class will be empty.
 *
 * **Usage**
 *
 * The basic API for this class is the same for all of the web service end
 * points. First you create a web service object with your MaxMind
 * <code>$userId</code> and <code>$licenseKey</code>, then you call the method
 * corresponding to a specific end point, passing it the IP address you want
 * to look up.
 *
 * If the request succeeds, the method call will return a model class for
 * the end point you called. This model in turn contains multiple record
 * classes, each of which represents part of the data returned by the web
 * service.
 *
 * If the request fails, the client class throws an exception.
