NAME
    GeoIP2 - PHP API for MaxMind's GeoIP2 Precision web services and GeoIP2
    databases

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    Currently, this distribution provides an API for the GeoIP2 Precision web
    services (as documented at http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/precision).

    In the future, this distribution will also provide the same API for the
    GeoIP2 downloadable databases. These databases have not yet been
    released as a downloadable product.

    See GeoIP2::Webservice::Client for details on the web service client
    API.

INTEGRATION WITH GEONAMES
    GeoNames (http://www.geonames.org/) offers web services and downloadable
    databases with data on geographical features around the world, including
    populated places. They offer both free and paid premium data. Each
    feature is unique identified by a "geoname_id", which is an integer.

    Many of the records returned by the GeoIP2 web services and databases
    include a "geoname_id" field. This is the ID of a geographical feature
    (city, region, country, etc.) in the GeoNames database.

    Some of the data that MaxMind provides is also sourced from GeoNames. We
    source things like place names, ISO codes, and other similar data from
    the GeoNames premium data set.

REPORTING DATA PROBLEMS
    If the problem you find is that an IP address is incorrectly mapped,
    please submit your correction to MaxMind at
    http://www.maxmind.com/en/correction.

    If you find some other sort of mistake, like an incorrect spelling,
    please check the GeoNames site (http://www.geonames.org/) first. Once
    you've searched for a place and found it on the GeoNames map view, there
    are a number of links you can use to correct data ("move", "edit",
    "alternate names", etc.). Once the correction is part of the GeoNames
    data set, it will be automatically incorporated into future MaxMind
    releases.

    If you are a paying MaxMind customer and you're not sure where to submit
    a correction, please contact MaxMind support at
    http://www.maxmind.com/en/support for help.
